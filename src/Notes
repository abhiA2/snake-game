Steps:

A. Declaring some variables say for

1. playArea dimensions
2. initial Position of Snake and Apple.
3. scale of the Game(Snake and apple)
4. timeDelay for the speed of snake

B. For rendering the final Game

1. take two images one for screen and one for apple (for later converting into pixelated view using "drawImage")
2. Take a canvas element to paint the screen for "gameBoard" aka "PlayArea".
3. A button for restarting the game.
4. Another div for scoreBox.(for highest score get the highest score from localStorage)

C. Functions Associated

1. Checking if the game is over
   CASE 1: If the snake collides with screen ("checkCollision()")
   CASE 2: If the snake eats itself ("appleAte")

2. Taking user Input for Navigation of Game ("changeDirection()")

3. Binding the parent div to a function named "playHandler()" that will reset all the values to initial value

4. A useEffect inside which the Snake's movement is converted into pixels and the square that snake passed is cleared

5. A run game callback used inside "useInterval()" basically to create a new Snake and for checking the two GameOver Cases
